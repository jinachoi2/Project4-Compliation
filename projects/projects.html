            I chose to stylize the lyrics of the pop song, "Unlock It" by Charli XCX (featuring Kim Petras and Jay Park). I chose this song because it had a euphoric, superficial, pop cultural feel to the music and lyrics, which I thought would be fun to visualize using retro web aesthetics. The song incorporates electronic tunes and sound effects to enhance the exaggerated, ecstatically artificial scene the lyrics portrays. The (super!) repetitive chorus of "lock it, lock it, lock it..." and punch line "Got the key can you unlock it?", the song give a feeling of a play, yet seductive, game.

              I explored the use of "grids," especially those used in modern designs, and attempted to deconstruct their normal function and aesthetics. The first example of grids I thought of were rigidly organized newspaper article grids. The grids used to organize heavy bodies of text are usually invisible or thinly-lined blocks that can look a bit overwhelming. I wanted to juxtapose this aspect of modern grids and show the light-hearted, amusing features of "grids." This was achieved by subtly materializing grid lines and showcasing small, random and playful, "retro" icons with old-style web cursors.

              I have a collection of birthday cards that I accumulated over the span of my life. I chose to present a record of a few of my birthday cards I collected like a digital storage space for the tangible cards. I was inspired by the aesthetics of a computer desktop and hoped to create a website that was more personal and intimate. As any birthday, I tried to incorporate bits of delight and celebration within the desktop (i.e. open the dock icons!). While I managed to position and size (and resize!) elements to fit the mobile (iPhone 6/7/8 plus) screens, I wasn't able to successfully changed the linked parts of the image. More about this is written in the <a class="processLink" href="../processes/processes.html">processes page</a>.

                I am satisfied with how my project 4 came out; lots of white space and minimal colors and elements. I enjoyed the planning and process of creating a black and white, light-themed website. I usually like playing with contrast and the ephemeral traits of light and shadow in my works and so I wanted to portray the same here. I definitely had a lot of light-bulb "a ha" moments during this course and thought I'd reflect that too.</p>

                I really wish we had more time to work on making the multi-page website more user-friendly. For example, because I use a lot of toggled headers, I'd like to have my menu icon, the circle, or another icon to directing users to the top of the page to have a sticky position so that it can stick down to the bottom of the page when scrolling down. This way users won't have to scroll all the way back up when viewing (especially for mobile device!!).
