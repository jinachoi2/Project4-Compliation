          Chimero offers interesting ideas of what digital mediums are like in the modern world and how designers should understand their qualities in order to appropriately design for users today. For example, treating technology as its own unique thing rather than fitting it into existing concepts or that screens are aesthetically neutral or that the flexibility or flux of screen devices allow for innovative design. As such, with the web and screen’s various functions and potential for novel uses, designers should understand how to use these differences or new features to create a valuable, more efficient use of these devices rather than play around their abstraction and reproduce what we are already familiar with.

          Ford illustrates a business exchange scenario to aid in explaining the complexities of coding softwares and software languages. While the reading gave quite an overwhelming depiction of the numerous programs (and those that will emerge in the future), it also showed the prevalence of coding as an essential skill and the importance of keeping up to date with new technology and trends.

          I really enjoyed how the “A Vernacular Web” article changed its designed to help demonstrate the various components of “past” web design aesthetics. This multi-page website helped illustrate the mood certain aesthetics can create and how designers could use this knowledge to enhance and bring novelty and nostalgia to their web designs. In fact, the article inspired me tackle the rigid, clean-cut aesthetics of designs today and juxtapose it with the “old,” retro styles and explore what mood that could create. It was interesting to see how versatile the web was in its ability to change atmospheres easily and convey different information just by creating additional pages, depth, interactive features etc. to design.

          The article, “Jodi’s Infrastructure” was also interesting as it talked about how the digital world could vary in its complexities and vastness depending on how the user or designer perceived it. How far and deep we use the computer to convey our art is essentially up to us and it is this trait that allows for the exciting explorations of “net art”. In this sense, web design is not only a tool to convey information but a way for users to play around, have fun and discover new ways of expressing ideas. I especially understood this meaning when looking at artist websites for inspiration and came across surprising ways to use the web.

          The problems of privacy and big-data collection as a mean of market research through the internet was not a new concept to me and I agree with Earle’s opinions that data should "not be filtered through secret algorithms for private gain.” However, it was intriguing to read that “privacy is meant to be a space of creative experimentation, free from judgment and beyond external control” and so it constricts individual exploration and societal progression. With this in mind, I realized that the current infrastructure of the internet hinders potential breakthroughs and clear, direct communication. These ideas were supported by Drulhe’s conceptual spatialization exercises, where the article illustrated various models (and a lot of them!) for how information could be censored, framed and even lost.

          Based on the previous readings and Weinberger’s article, there is a general consensus in that previously, the web was treated as an exploration, of establishing the grounds of the internet, whereas the web’s development today is becoming stagnant and is disconnecting valuable communication. The “New Clues” article further claims that the internet is “us” and that we are the ones that create and change to the web. It explained that the internet was not a medium and did not consist of content, which I thought was a surprising opinion. Instead, it fed off of human care, thoughts and emotions; an open, humane movement. However, I think it may take awhile for this theory to take effect in the future. With problems of privacy, data collecting and cyber policies, it may be difficult to positively accept the Internet for what it should be used for (…but what should it actually be used for?) and abide to idealistic rules. The article prompts us as designers to think about how we influence or communicate with users “online” and raise awareness of our designs on a social, political and ethical note.
